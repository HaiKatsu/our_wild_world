Wallace\u2019s flying frog is thought to be the first flying frog discovered, by the the famous naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace (after whom the frog is named).<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\"><strong>They look a bit silly, don\u2019t they?

It\u2019s hard to know the exact range of Wallace\u2019s flying frog, as there are a number of similar species that occur in the same area. I also imagine it\u2019s not always easy to find frogs in a rainforest, though I\u2019ve never tried, so I can\u2019t say for sure.&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">Wallace\u2019s flying frog is found in tropical rainforests in Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand.

They are big for flying frogs, but that only means about eight to ten centimetres. They also blend in pretty well with their surroundings, with bright green colouration on top, and a white belly. And because they spend most of their time high in trees, you can imagine how difficult it might be to find small, leaf coloured frogs in the canopy of a rainforest.<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">The most notable features of Wallace\u2019s flying frogs are their webbed feet. They have very large feet, with yellow and black webbing that reaches all the way to the toes. Flying frogs also have a small flap of skin between their limbs, which help a lot with their gliding capabilities.&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">Since they are expert gliders, Wallace\u2019s flying frogs spend almost all their time in trees. After all, if you can only glide and not fly, you need to get to a high place to glide from. When flying frogs feel threatened, they leap off whatever perch they\u2019re on, and simply glide through the air until they find a safe landing spot. Thanks to their huge feet and webbing, flying frogs can glide over 50 feet.&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\"><strong>A stunning close up of a flying frog.

They have large toe pads at the end of each finger, which allow them to cushion the landing and stick to vertical surfaces with ease. It\u2019s not just the toe pads that are special either \u2014 the frogs have cool bones in their feet that help press the pads against surfaces, creating the suction needed to grip the surface.<\/p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">Mating in Wallace\u2019s flying frogs is not the most exciting affair. Female frogs secrete a fluid which they churn into a frothy foam. She then lays her eggs in the foam, after which the male fertilizes the eggs. It\u2019s very important that the parents construct the foam nest over water, otherwise when the eggs hatch, they will fall onto dry ground and die due to lack of moisture.<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">Although they can\u2019t actually fly, I think flying frogs do their best, and should be appreciated for trying. After all, it\u2019s no easy feat to be able to glide for over 50 feet, and then stick (quite literally) the landing. I know I certainly couldn\u2019t, even with specialized equipment!&nbsp;<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\">Cover image by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Rhacophorus_nigropalmatus.jpg\">Rushenb<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0<\/a>, via Wikimedia Commons<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u2018Flying\u2019 and \u2018frogs\u2019 are not two words you often hear in the same sentence.
